## ⚙️ Challenges We Faced

- **Integrating Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech** simultaneously caused conflicts. We solved this by separating concerns and handling speech actions in isolated React hooks.
- **Responsive UI for Emotion Graphs** was tricky. Tailwind and conditional rendering solved the visual issues.
